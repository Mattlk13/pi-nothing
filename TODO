rename (use) to (kill-reg) in lir for register allocation

figure out whether the no-kills-on-tail-call-restoration-of-saves is
correct; I commented it out because it was causing spurious saves of
all savables in the (x (x (x))) example.

try to figure out a way to use STM and LDM in ARM backend

fix calling convention for ARM:
  if a 0ary procedure tail-calls a 1ary procedure, it needs to make
  sure the stack-pointer is 16-byte aligned like everywhere else does.
  Currently it isn't doing that. If it does, then we probably need to
  make the calling convention align the arguments being passed at the
  *top* of the args region rather than the bottom. Or, make it the
  callee's responsibility to align the stack pointer? Or ditch
  alignment?
